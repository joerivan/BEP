# HPC

For setting the number of steps and distance change the values in data/param. The first value is distance in Angstrom and the second the number of steps. The number of steps should also be changed in the submit files.

## Dependencies

To make sure everything runs correctly, a local python environment needs to be made. 
In this environment the python packages `ase`, `numpy`, `matplotlib`, and `Pillow` need to be installed.

## Usage

One should check the directories to be correctly set before they run their calculations. Some directories might need to be created before running the calculations.
For additional information read the comments in the files.
